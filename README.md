# Vue - Vite - ECharts - Vue-Grid-Layout

This is a minimal working example of Vue 3, Vite, ECharts, Vue-Grid-Layout, Typescript, and TailwindCSS.

Admittedly the code is a little sloppy and could use some cleanup. I just threw this repo up after getting everything working to share it and save it as a reference.

## Usage

### Install Dependencies

```
yarn
```

### Use it

```
yarn dev
```

This will serve the app at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

### Build it

```
yarn build
```

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles Vue in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
